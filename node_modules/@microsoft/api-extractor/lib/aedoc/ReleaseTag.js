/**
  * A "release tag" is a custom TSDoc tag that is applied to an API to communicate the level of support
  * provided for third-party developers.
  *
  * @remarks
  *
  * The four release tags are: `@internal`, `@alpha`, `@beta`, and `@public`. They are applied to API items such
  * as classes, member functions, enums, etc.  The release tag applies recursively to members of a container
  * (e.g. class or interface). For example, if a class is marked as `@beta`, then all of its members automatically
  * have this status; you DON'T need add the `@beta` tag to each member function. However, you could add
  * `@internal` to a member function to give it a different release status.
  *
  * @public
