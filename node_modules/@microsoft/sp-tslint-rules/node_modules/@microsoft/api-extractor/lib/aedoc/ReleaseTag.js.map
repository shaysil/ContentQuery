They are applied to API items such\r\n  * as classes, member functions, enums, etc.  The release tag applies recursively to members of a container\r\n  * (e.g. class or interface). For example, if a class is marked as `@beta`, then all of its members automatically\r\n  * have this status; you DON'T need add the `@beta` tag to each member function. However, you could add\r\n  * `@internal` to a member function to give it a different release status.\r\n  *\r\n  * @public\r\n  */\r\nexport enum ReleaseTag {\r\n  /**\r\n   * No release tag was specified in the AEDoc summary.\r\n   */\r\n  None = 0,\r\n  /**\r\n   * Indicates that an API item is meant only for usage by other NPM packages from the same\r\n   * maintainer.
